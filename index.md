I am M.Sc. student in the [Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) advised by [Prof. Suleyman Serdar Kozat](http://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~kozat/). My bachelor is in the same department and university. I also work as a full time Data Scientist at [Databoss](http://data-boss.com.tr) company. My research focuses on Spatio-temporal series forecasting including weather prediction and event prediction. With my research group, we develop deep learning tools for time series prediction. Besides, I worked on Natural Language Processing projects including Named Entity Recognition and Sentiment detection.
